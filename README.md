# Xcode Snippets

Introduction in a nutshell (I don't like the verbosity of methods name)

## Type of snippets

### Aliases

### Bunch of annoying but useful code

## Using CodeSnippets

### Installation

In order to use these snippets, you have to `git clone https://github.com/skyless/Snippets.git CodeSnippets` into your `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/` folder.

Then Xcode must be closed and reopen to reload the awesome snippets.

OR if you already have some snippets of yours :

```
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/skyless/Snippets.git
git pull origin master
```

### Categories of snippets
